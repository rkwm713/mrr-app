# Checklist

**Project Checklist: Web-Based Make-Ready Report Generator**

**Developer:** Ryan Miller

**Date Started:** 5/13

**Instructions for AI Agent:**

Please mark each task as completed by placing an [X] in the checkbox or noting DONE next to it. If a step requires multiple sub-actions (like implementing many parser functions), you can add sub-checkboxes or notes for finer-grained tracking.

**Project Completion Status:** [IN PROGRESS]

**AI Agent Notes/Challenges:**

- All code structure is in place, but the application needs to be manually tested in a browser
- Some of the more complex extraction functions for unmatched poles and attachment identification would need refinement based on actual data format
- Certain features like identifying the "To Pole" in spans would need further development if exact requirements are provided

---

This checklist reflects that we have completed the setup, structure implementation, and most functionality for the Make-Ready Report Generator. The next step would be to thoroughly test the application with the provided sample data in a browser.
