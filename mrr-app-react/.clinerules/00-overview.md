# Make-Ready Report Generator Overview

## Project Purpose

The Make-Ready Report Generator is a web-based tool that automates the generation of Make-Ready Reports (MRR) from SPIDAcalc and Katapult JSON data sources. This tool helps utilities, construction companies, and attachment owners streamline the pole attachment process by extracting, correlating, and organizing critical data into standardized Excel reports.

## Business Value

- **Eliminate Manual Work**: Remove the need for manual data entry between systems
- **Reduce Errors**: Minimize transcription errors and inconsistencies
- **Save Time**: Automate the generation of standardized reports
- **Improve Decision Making**: Provide clear visibility into make-ready requirements
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Create a common data format for all stakeholders

## Technical Overview

This client-side application runs entirely in the web browser, processing JSON data from two primary sources:

1. **SPIDAcalc**: Pole structural analysis tool that provides engineering data
2. **Katapult**: Field data collection tool that provides measurement data

The application correlates poles between these sources, extracts relevant data according to a defined mapping, and generates a standardized Excel report containing make-ready information.

## Key Challenges

- **Complex Data Structures**: Both SPIDAcalc and Katapult use nested, complex JSON structures
- **Data Correlation**: Matching poles between systems with potentially inconsistent identifiers
- **Dynamic Data Access**: Handling variable paths and optional fields in the JSON
- **Performance**: Processing potentially large files (500+ poles) efficiently in the browser
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handling missing or inconsistent data

## Using These Rules Files

The `.clinerules` directory contains project-specific rules organized by topic:

- **00-overview.md**: This file - project purpose and overview
- **01-coding-standards.md**: Code style, JSON handling, error handling, performance
- **02-data-mapping.md**: Data extraction strategy, field-specific rules
- **03-development-workflow.md**: Development phases, testing, code organization
- **04-error-handling-testing.md**: Error handling patterns, testing strategy

These rules ensure:
- Consistent code quality and style
- Proper handling of complex data structures
- Systematic development approach
- Robust error handling and testing
