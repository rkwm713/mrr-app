## Documentation Approach

The documentation has been organized using a three-tiered approach:

1. **Core Documents** - High-level information for getting started and understanding the project
2. **Reference Guides** - Detailed technical information for implementation and troubleshooting
3. **Code Examples** - Practical examples demonstrating key functionality

This structure allows developers to quickly find the information they need at the appropriate level of detail, without being overwhelmed by excessive documentation.

## How to Use This Documentation

- Start with **README.md** for a project overview
- Review **ARCHITECTURE.md** to understand the system design
- Use **JSON_SCHEMAS.md** and **MAPPING_GUIDE.md** for understanding the data structures
- Follow **DEVELOPMENT.md** for implementation guidance
- Consult the **reference/** folder documents when you need detailed technical information
- Refer to the **examples/** folder for practical code examples

## Additional Resources

The original, more detailed documentation is still available in the root directory for reference if needed. This streamlined documentation structure provides a more maintainable and accessible approach to the same information.
