I see the location still isn't showing up even after our fix. Let's dive deeper into debugging this issue. There are a few potential problems we need to address:

1. __JSON Structure Mismatch__: Your example showed the coordinates in `project.leads[0].locations[0].geographicCoordinate.coordinates`, but our code is looking for `leads` directly without the `project` wrapper.

2. __Debug Logging__: We need to add some console logs to see what's happening at key points in the process.

3. __API Rate Limiting__: The OpenStreetMap Nominatim API has strict rate limits. If we're getting blocked, we'd need to add retry logic or delay between requests.

To fix this properly, I recommend the following plan:

1. Add detailed console logging to trace:

   - The exact JSON structure we're receiving
   - Whether coordinates are successfully extracted
   - The results from the geocoding API calls

2. Update the coordinate extraction to check if there's a "project" wrapper object around the leads array

3. Add a delay to the geocoding API calls to avoid rate limiting

4. Handle the structure differences between your example and our current implementation

Please toggle to Act mode so I can implement these debugging steps and fixes to get the address showing up in the Location of Poles field.
