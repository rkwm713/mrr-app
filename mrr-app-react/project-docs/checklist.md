**Project Completion Status:** [DONE]

**AI Agent Notes/Challenges:**

The implementation has been completed with the following enhancements:

1. **Improved Pole Correlation**: Implemented normalized pole number matching to handle variations between systems (like prefixes, casing differences)

2. **Enhanced Data Extraction**:
   - Improved identification of Charter/Spectrum attachments with flexible company name matching
   - Implemented robust detection of Install/Relocate/Existing actions
   - Added comprehensive unit conversions between metric and imperial measurements

3. **Error Handling and Data Quality**:
   - Implemented standardized default values for missing data
   - Added robust error handling for all extraction functions
   - Added validation to ensure safe data access

4. **Reporting Features**:
   - Added match status tracking for each pole (Full Match, SPIDA Only, Katapult Only)
   - Added support for including all pole types in the report
   - Added detailed summary information in the UI

5. **Future Improvements**:
   - "To Pole" identification in spans would require enhanced connectivity analysis between poles
   - Dynamic filtering of report data could be added to focus on specific pole types or attachment actions
   - Performance optimization for very large datasets could be implemented if needed
   - User-configurable confidence thresholds for pole matching
   - Visual indicators of match confidence in the UI
   - Ability to manually review and correct low-confidence matches
