Okay, let's look at how to find the **Pole Owner** in your `CPS_6457E_03_SPIDAcalc.json` file.

According to the "Make-Ready Report Generator" guide you provided, the primary source for the Pole Owner is SPIDAcalc.

**Pole Owner**

* **Purpose**: Identifies the company or entity that owns the pole structure.
* **Standard Path (as per your provided mapping guide)**:
    `project.leads[*].locations[*].designs[?(@.layerType=="Measured")].structure.pole.owner.id`
    * `[*]` indicates iteration through arrays for `leads` and `locations`.
    * `[?(@.layerType=="Measured")]` is a filter to select the "Measured" design layer. This is important because pole ownership is typically an attribute of the existing structure.
    * `.owner.id` then accesses the ID of the owning entity.

* **Example Path from your JSON structure (for the first lead, first location, "Measured Design"):**
    This means you'd navigate to: `project.leads[0].locations[0].designs[0].structure.pole.owner.id`
    (Assuming `designs[0]` corresponds to the design where `layerType` is "Measured").

* **Actual JSON Snippet**:
    Let's look at the first pole (location `1-PL410620`) in your `CPS_6457E_03_SPIDAcalc.json` file:
    ```json
    {
      "project": {
        // ... other project properties ...
        "leads": [
          {
            "label": "Lead",
            "locations": [
              {
                "label": "1-PL410620",
                // ... other location properties ...
                "designs": [
                  {
                    "label": "Measured Design",
                    "layerType": "Measured",
                    "structure": {
                      "pole": {
                        "id": "Pole",
                        "externalId": "67fe5b40d23586d211b6a229",
                        "owner": {
                          "industry": "UTILITY",
                          "id": "CPS Energy"  // <--- This is the Pole Owner ID
                        },
                        "glc": { /* ... */ },
                        "agl": { /* ... */ },
                        "clientItemVersion": "34ac6872feabadde322a3f91f1bb13eb",
                        "clientItem": {
                          "species": "Southern Pine",
                          "classOfPole": "4",
                          "height": {
                            "unit": "METRE",
                            "value": 12.192000000000002
                          }
                        },
                        "clientItemAlias": "40-4"
                        // ... other pole properties ...
                      }
                      // ... other structure properties (wires, equipment, etc.) ...
                    }
                    // ... other design properties ...
                  },
                  {
                    "label": "Recommended Design",
                    "layerType": "Recommended"
                    // ... (structure for recommended design) ...
                  }
                ]
              }
              // ... other locations ...
            ]
          }
          // ... other leads ...
        ]
        // ... other project properties ...
      }
    }
    ```
    In this snippet, by following the path `project.leads[0].locations[0].designs[0].structure.pole.owner.id`, you would retrieve the value `"CPS Energy"`. This indicates that "CPS Energy" is the owner of this specific pole in its measured state.

    You would iterate this logic for each location (pole) within each lead in your project file. Remember to always specifically look for the design where `layerType == "Measured"` to get the existing pole owner.
