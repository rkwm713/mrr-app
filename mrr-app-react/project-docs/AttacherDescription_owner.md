To find all the different owner names for attachments located at or below the height of the (lowest CPS) neutral wire on each pole using the "existing" data, you will primarily use the **`CPS_6457E_03_Katapult.json`** file. This file contains detailed measured field data, including attachment heights and owner information.

Here's a step-by-step approach for each pole:

**Using `CPS_6457E_03_Katapult.json`:**

For each `node_id` (which represents a pole) in the `nodes` object:

1.  **Determine the Height of the Lowest CPS Neutral Wire:**
    * Navigate to `nodes[node_id].attributes.equipment`. This object contains all equipment attached to the pole.
    * Iterate through each piece of equipment (identified by its unique `equipment_id` key).
    * Identify the CPS Energy neutral wire(s) by checking:
        * `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].owner_name.one` (or `.multi_added`) for "CPS Energy" (or a known variant like "CPS").
        * `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].equipment_type.button_added` (or `.one`, `.auto_button`, etc.) for values like "Neutral", "Secondary Neutral", or other relevant electrical neutral identifiers.
        * `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].conductor_type.button_added` (or `.one`) can also indicate the type, e.g., "Neutral".
    * Extract the attachment height for each identified CPS neutral wire. This is typically found in:
        * `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].attachment_height_ft` (e.g., "32'-5\""). This string value needs to be converted to decimal feet (e.g., 32.42 feet).
        * `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].measured_height_ft` or similar height fields, also requiring conversion if in "ft-in" format.
    * If there are multiple CPS neutral wires on the pole, determine the height of the *lowest* one. This will be your reference neutral height for that pole. If no CPS neutral is found, you cannot proceed for that pole based on this specific criterion.

2.  **Identify All Attachments At or Below the Determined Neutral Height:**
    * Once you have the lowest CPS neutral height for the current pole:
        * Iterate again through all equipment under `nodes[node_id].attributes.equipment`.
        * For each piece of equipment, extract its attachment height using the same fields as above (e.g., `attachment_height_ft`, `measured_height_ft`) and convert it to decimal feet.
        * Compare this attachment's height to the determined lowest CPS neutral height.
        * Keep a list of all attachments whose height is less than or equal to the neutral's height.

3.  **Extract Owner Names for These Qualifying Attachments:**
    * For each attachment that is at or below the neutral height:
        * Extract the owner's name. This is typically found in `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].owner_name.one` or `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].owner_name.multi_added`.
        * Other fields like `attributes.equipment[equipment_id].company_name.one` might also contain owner information. Prioritize `owner_name`.

4.  **Compile a Unique List of Owner Names:**
    * Collect all owner names extracted in step 3 from all poles.
    * Create a unique set of these owner names to get the final list of all different owners with attachments at or below the neutral level across all surveyed poles.

**Example Snippet Walkthrough (Conceptual for a single pole):**

Let's assume for pole `-OJ_PMjpiNrD4UyT0JSz`:
* You find a CPS Energy Neutral wire with `attachment_height_ft: "30-0"` (30.0 feet). This is the lowest CPS neutral.
* Then you find the following attachments:
    * Equipment A: `owner_name.one: "AT&T"`, `attachment_height_ft: "28-0"` (28.0 feet) -> Below neutral. Owner: AT&T.
    * Equipment B: `owner_name.one: "Charter"`, `attachment_height_ft: "25-0"` (25.0 feet) -> Below neutral. Owner: Charter.
    * Equipment C: `owner_name.one: "AT&T"`, `attachment_height_ft: "22-0"` (22.0 feet) -> Below neutral. Owner: AT&T.
    * Equipment D: `owner_name.one: "CPS Energy"`, `equipment_type.button_added: "Secondary"`, `attachment_height_ft: "32-0"` (32.0 feet) -> Above neutral. Ignore.

For this pole, the owners with attachments at or below the neutral are "AT&T" and "Charter". You would repeat this for all poles and then combine all such unique owner names.

**Using `CPS_6457E_03_SPIDAcalc.json` (for modeled data, less direct for "existing field data"):**

If you were to look at the modeled data for the "Measured Design":

1.  **Path:** `leads[index].locations[index].designs[]` (find object where `label == "Measured Design"`).
2.  **Find Neutral Height:**
    * In `structure.wires[]`, identify wires where `owner.id == "CPS ENERGY"` and `clientItem.usageGroups` contains "NEUTRAL" or similar.
    * Get the `attachmentHeight.value` for these (note: this will be in meters and needs conversion). Determine the lowest.
3.  **Find Attachments Below Neutral:**
    * Iterate through all items in `structure.wires[]` and `structure.equipments[]`.
    * Compare their `attachmentHeight.value` (converted) to the neutral height.
4.  **Extract Owner:** Get `owner.id` for qualifying attachments.
5.  **Compile Unique List.**

This approach gives owner IDs based on the model, which might be less descriptive than the names in the Katapult file and reflects the modeled state, not necessarily the direct field measurements of every single existing item with full ownership details as captured in Katapult.

For your query about "all the different owner names" from "existing data" "neutral and below," the **`CPS_6457E_03_Katapult.json`** file is the more direct and appropriate source.
