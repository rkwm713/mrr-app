Okay, I will provide guidance on how to find the data to populate the columns in the image you provided. This involves extracting information from both the Katapult and SPIDAcalc JSON files.

**Understanding the Columns in Your Image:**

  * **Existing Mid-Span Data:**
      * `Height Lowest Com`: The lowest height of a communication wire at mid-span.
      * `Height Lowest CPS Electrical`: The lowest height of a CPS Energy electrical wire at mid-span.
      * `From Pole` / `To Pole`: The identifiers of the poles spanning the mid-span section.
  * **Make Ready Data:**
      * `Attacher Description`: The type or description of the attachment on the pole.
      * `Attachment Height - Existing`: The current height of an attachment on a pole.
      * `Attachment Height - Proposed`: The new height of an attachment on a pole after make-ready work.
      * `Mid-Span - Proposed`: The proposed mid-span height (or clearance) of a wire/cable after make-ready.
      * `Reference or Other_pole [cardinal direction] to [pole_number]`: This seems to describe the span context.

**I. Existing Mid-Span Data (Primarily from `CPS_6457E_03_Katapult.json`)**

1.  **`From Pole` / `To Pole`:**

      * **Path (Katapult):** `connections.<connection_id>.node_id_1` and `connections.<connection_id>.node_id_2`.
          * These `node_id_1` and `node_id_2` values are internal Katapult IDs. You'll need to map these back to your user-facing pole numbers (like "PL410620").
          * To get the pole number (e.g., "PL410620"), look up the `node_id` in the `nodes` object: `nodes[node_id_1].attributes.PoleNumber["-Imported"]` or `nodes[node_id_1].attributes.PL_number["-Imported"]`. Do the same for `node_id_2`.
      * **JSON Snippet (Katapult - conceptual for one connection):**
        ```json
        // connections["-OJ_PU-ftGPy7TovEc5a"]
        {
          "node_id_1": "-OJ_PU-d5b_qyvPLb1ox", // Corresponds to "From Pole"
          "node_id_2": "-OJ_PMjpiNrD4UyT0JSz", // Corresponds to "To Pole"
          // ...
          "sections": {
            // Mid-span sections with annotations and height data are in here
          }
        }

        // To get human-readable pole numbers for node_id_1:
        // nodes["-OJ_PU-d5b_qyvPLb1ox"].attributes.PoleNumber["-Imported"] (e.g., "PL379971")
        // nodes["-OJ_PMjpiNrD4UyT0JSz"].attributes.PoleNumber["-Imported"] (e.g., "PL370858")
        ```

2.  **`Height Lowest Com` (Existing Mid-Span):**

      * **Path (Katapult):** For each `connection` and its mid-span `sections`:
          * `connections[connection_id].sections[section_id].annotations[annotation_id]`
          * Identify communication wires by checking `attributes.equipment_type.button_added` (e.g., "Communication", "Fiber", "Coax") or `attributes.owner_name.one` for known communication companies.
          * Extract height from `height_ft_decimal` or parse from `measured_height_ft`.
      * **Logic:** Iterate through all annotations in all mid-span sections of a given span. Find the minimum height among all identified communication wires. Convert to a standard format (e.g., 14'-10" from your image).
      * **JSON Snippet (Katapult - annotation within a mid-span section):**
        ```json
        // ...connections[connection_id].sections[section_id].annotations[annotation_id]
        {
          "attributes": {
            "equipment_type": { "button_added": "Communication" },
            "owner_name": { "one": "AT&T" }
          },
          "height_ft_decimal": 14.83, // Approx 14'-10"
          "measured_height_ft": "14'-10\""
        }
        ```

3.  **`Height Lowest CPS Electrical` (Existing Mid-Span):**

      * **Path (Katapult):** Similar to "Height Lowest Com".
          * Identify CPS electrical wires by `attributes.owner_name.one == "CPS Energy"` AND `attributes.equipment_type.button_added` being an electrical type ("Primary", "Secondary", "Neutral"). Also check notes like in `connections["-OJif9TaTKzDx4iAqQeV"].sections["-OJt1tLn65I6PCgLr-xf"].multi_attributes.note` which might contain "Hot stick measurements" (e.g., "neutral 28:9").
          * Extract height from `height_ft_decimal`, parse `measured_height_ft`, or parse from notes.
      * **Logic:** For a given span, find the minimum height among all identified CPS electrical wires in its mid-span sections. Convert to a standard format (e.g., 23'-10" from your image).
      * **JSON Snippet (Katapult - mid-span section note):**
        ```json
        // connections["-OJif9TaTKzDx4iAqQeV"].sections["-OJt1tLn65I6PCgLr-xf"].multi_attributes
        {
          "note": {
            "-OL-NT3rkwEDXrPEvVnn": "Hot stick measurements:\nprimary 38:2\nneutral 28:9" // This would be 28.75 feet. The 23'-10" in image is different.
          }
        }
        ```
        *Note: The example `23'-10"` in your image for "Height Lowest CPS Electrical" would need to be found in a similar annotation or note field specifically for a CPS electrical wire at mid-span.*

**II. Make Ready Data (Pole Attachments - Existing and Proposed)**

This involves looking at attachments *on the pole* for a specific pole number (e.g., PL410620).

1.  **`Attacher Description` and `Attachment Height - Existing` (from `CPS_6457E_03_Katapult.json`)**

      * Identify the target pole by its number (e.g., "PL410620") by searching `nodes[node_id].attributes.PoleNumber["-Imported"]`.
      * **Path (Katapult):** `nodes[pole_node_id].attributes.equipment[equipment_id]`
          * `Attacher Description`: Can be derived from `equipment_type.button_added` (e.g., "Neutral"), `conductor_type.button_added`, or a combination with `owner_name.one`. Your image shows "Neutral", "CPS Supply Fiber", "Charter Spectrum Fiber Optic", etc.
          * `Attachment Height - Existing`: From `attachment_height_ft` (e.g., "29'-6"") or `measured_height_ft`. Convert to feet-inches string format.
      * **JSON Snippet (Katapult - equipment on a pole):**
        ```json
        // nodes["-OJ_PMjpiNrD4UyT0JSz"].attributes.equipment["equip_id_example"]
        {
          "attachment_height_ft": "29'-6\"", // Existing Attachment Height
          "equipment_type": { "button_added": "Neutral" }, // Part of Attacher Description
          "owner_name": { "one": "CPS Energy" } // Part of Attacher Description
        }
        ```

2.  **`Attacher Description`, `Attachment Height - Proposed`, and `Mid-Span - Proposed` (from `CPS_6457E_03_SPIDAcalc.json`)**

      * Identify the target pole location in SPIDAcalc, e.g., `leads[index].locations[index]` where `label` matches your pole number (e.g., "1-PL410620").

      * Navigate to the `designs` array and select the object where `label == "Recommended Design"`.

      * **`Attacher Description` and `Attachment Height - Proposed` (Pole Attachments):**

          * **Path (SPIDAcalc):** `...designs[label=="Recommended Design"].structure.wires[j]`
              * `Attacher Description`: From `owner.id` combined with `clientItem.size` or `clientItem.usageGroups`. E.g., `owner.id: "CHARTER"`, `clientItem.size: "ORF-O-048-CA"` could be "Charter Spectrum Fiber Optic".
              * `Attachment Height - Proposed`: From `attachmentHeight.value` (in meters, convert to feet and then to ft-in string format, e.g., 24'-7").
          * **JSON Snippet (SPIDAcalc - proposed wire on pole):**
            ```json
            // ...structure.wires[j]
            {
              "owner": { "id": "Charter" },
              "clientItem": { "size": "ORF-O-048-CA" }, // Example "Charter Spectrum Fiber Optic"
              "attachmentHeight": { "unit": "METRE", "value": 7.493 } // Approx 24'-7"
            }
            ```

      * **`Mid-Span - Proposed` (for Span Wires):**

          * This refers to the calculated mid-span height (or clearance) above ground for wires in the "Recommended Design".
          * **Path (SPIDAcalc):**
            1.  Identify the relevant `spanWire` in `...designs[label=="Recommended Design"].structure.spanWires[k]`. This span wire will have an `id` (e.g., "SpanWire\#Y") and owner/type details.
            2.  Then, find the analysis results for this span: `...designs[label=="Recommended Design"].analysis[m].results[n]`.
            3.  Look for an object where `component == "SpanWire#Y"` (matching the ID from step 1) and `analysisType` is something like "CLEARANCE\_MINIMUM\_MIDSPAN" or a ground clearance check.
            4.  The `actual` value (if the `unit` is "METRE" or "FOOT") is the proposed mid-span height/clearance. Convert this from meters to feet, then to ft-in string (e.g., 21'-1").
          * **JSON Snippet (SPIDAcalc - spanWire details for sag calculation):**
            ```json
            // ...structure.spanWires[k]
            {
              "id": "SpanWire#Y",
              "owner": { "id": "Charter" },
              "clientItem": { "size": "ORF-O-048-CA" }, // Example "Charter Spectrum Fiber Optic"
              "attachmentHeightAtStructure1": { "unit": "METRE", "value": 7.493 }, // ~24'-7"
              "attachmentHeightAtStructure2": { "unit": "METRE", "value": 7.500 }, // Height at other pole
              "sagging": {
                "sags": [
                  {
                    "condition": "MAX_SAG", // Or other relevant condition
                    "sag": { "unit": "METRE", "value": 1.0668 } // Approx 3'-6" sag
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
            // Estimated Mid-span height from lower attachment: min(24.58, 24.60) - 3.50 = ~21.08 feet (approx 21'-1")
            // This assumes level ground. For true ground clearance, see analysis results.
            ```
          * **JSON Snippet (SPIDAcalc - analysis result for mid-span clearance):**
            ```json
            // ...designs[label=="Recommended Design"].analysis[m].results[n]
            {
              "actual": 6.425184, // Example: 21.08 feet (approx 21'-1")
              "unit": "METRE",    // Or "FOOT"
              "component": "SpanWire#Y", // ID of the span wire
              "analysisType": "CLEARANCE_MINIMUM_MIDSPAN" // Or similar
            }
            ```

**Summary Table Context:**

  * The table appears to be structured *per pole* for the "Make Ready Data" section (e.g., pole PL410620).
  * The "Existing Mid-Span Data" section refers to the span *between* two poles. You'll need to identify the correct span from the `connections` object in Katapult that corresponds to the "From Pole" and "To Pole" in your table.

To populate your table accurately, you'll need to:

1.  For each pole in your list (e.g., PL410620):
      * Extract its "Existing" pole attachment data from Katapult (`nodes[node_id].attributes.equipment`).
      * Extract its "Proposed" pole attachment data from SPIDAcalc's "Recommended Design" (`structure.wires` and `structure.equipments`).
2.  For each span defined by "From Pole" and "To Pole" in your table:
      * Find the corresponding `connection` in Katapult to get existing mid-span heights.
      * For the "Proposed Mid-Span" column, find the corresponding `spanWires` in SPIDAcalc's "Recommended Design" and their calculated mid-span clearances/heights.

This systematic approach, using the correct paths and fields in each JSON file, will allow you to populate your table. Remember to be careful with unit conversions and matching internal IDs to user-facing pole numbers.
